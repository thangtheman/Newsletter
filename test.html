        <p> <ul>
            <li>Encourage users to "turn on notifications" of your posts so that your content does not fall to the bottom of a users feed.  By doing this, if users can't keep up with their feed, they can at least keep track of your content.</li>
            <li> Continue producing content that is engaging so that it keeps getting pushing to the top of feeds.  The more people that remember your content, the less this update will affect you.</li>

        <p>Instagram has also extended their video lenth to 60 seconds from their previous ability of 15 seconds.  Instagram will be extending their video play in the near future...</p>

          <p>  It's important to think of campaigns that might be suitable for these longer timeframes.  Tell a story, highlight products, and make these 60 seconds count.  Also think about extended video ads.  The more time potential users have to learn about you, the more they can converted to actual users.

            <p>Snapchat has updated its chat feature to include stickers, somewhat like the ones seen in Facebook Messenger.</p>
            <p>Making a bold move from text chats only, they have enhanced their video options. Now, one can now make audio or videophone calls to another user via chat. Also one can leave audio notes in a chat box. This is cool update for users and can be transmitted for business use for customer care!</p>
            <p> Geo-filters have taken the world by storm. Snapchat allows companies and individuals to set up a geofilter in a localized setting.  You can design your very own filter and have it set up for a certain amount of time. </p>

    In order to aid the visually impaired, Twitter has launched a new function that lets users upload a picture with an image description. This description has been launched to hold up to 420 characters.  Never before have images been able to be transcribed to the visually impaired on a social network!
</p>
            <p class="blue">What you should do to maximize this?
            </p>
            <p><ul>
            <li>Research from this past year has noted that tweets with pictures have a 313% higher rate of engagement.</li>
            <li>When an image has descriptions, it is easier to search engines to identify a  specific search. This will help move your content higher on the Google search.</li>
